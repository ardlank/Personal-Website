            Hey! My names is Ardlan Khalili (as you may already know) but most people call me Ardy. I am originally from Mashhad, Iran and immigrated to the States at the age of 4. I currently live in Nashville, TN and feel at home there, as I have lived there for most of existence.<br/><br/>

            I went to The University of Tennessee at Knoxville for my Bachelor's in Engineering  in Computer Science. I graduated with a Summa Cum Laude degree and was awarded half a dozen departmental scholarships during my time there.<br/><br/>

            I have also had a good amount of luck in my professional career. I have been fortunate enough to work in some cutting-edge fields and have gained some publicity for it e.g. articles and publications. <br/><br/>

            When I am not writing code or educating people about, I enjoy some casual hobbies. What consumes the most amount of my free time would be soccer and market analysis. However, I love trying new activities and hobbies.<br/>
